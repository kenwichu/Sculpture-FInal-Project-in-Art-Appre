                    <h3>Sculpting Materials</h3>
                    <p>Any material that can be shaped in three-dimensions and are used for shaping, carving, or molding into desired forms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Commonly used/traditional sculpture materials</strong></p>
                    <p><i>Stone</i><br>- Througout the history, stone has been the principal material for monumental sculpture. The reason for this:<br>
                        1. many types of stone are highly resistant to the weathering, making them suitable for external user;<br>2. stone is widely available in all parts of the world and can be obtained in large blocks; and<br>3. many stones have a fairly homogenous texture and uniform hardness, making them suitable for carving.<br></p>
                    <p><i>Wood</i><br>- Wood has also been used by every great civilization and was used extensively udring the Middle Ages. In the 20th century, many sculptors used wood as a medium for carving.<br>- Both hardwoods and softwoods can be used for sculpting. The grain of the wood is one of its most attractive features, offering a variety of pattern ans and textures to its surfaces.
                        Also, its colors are subtle and varied.<br>- Wood is used mainly for indoor sculpture, as:<br>1. it is not as tough or durable as stone;<br>2. the changes in humidity and temperature may cause its vulnerability to splitting; and<br>3. it is prone to infestation by insects and fungus.<br>
                        - In general, wood has a warmth that stone does not have, but it lanks the massive dignity and weight of stone.</p>
                    <p><i>Metal</i><br>- Wherever metal technology was developed, metal has been used in sculpture.<br>- They are versatile and durable and has been used by artists for centuries.<br>They are known for:<br>1. various techniques such as casting, welding, forging, and fabrication; and<br>2. finished looks in different ways, including polishing, patination, painting, and texturing, allowing for a variety of aesthetic effects.<br>
                        - They may require occasional maintenance to prevent corrosion or damage.</p>
                    <p><i>Clay</i><br>- Is the most common, easily available and cheap of all materials used in sculpting.<br>Has four(4) characteristics and can be widely used:<br>1. when wet, it is the mst plastic of all substances, making it easy to shape and capture fine details;<br>2. when partially dried or completely dried, it becomes firm enough for carving or scraping;<br>3. when mixed with enough water, it turns to a creamy liquid, perfect for pouring into molds;<br>
                        4. when burned, it undergoes permanent structural changes, becoming hard and highly durable.</p>
                    <p><i>Ivory</i><br>- It is a dense, hard substance found in the tusks of mammals.<br>- It is milky white in color that turn yellow with age.<br>- Working with it is challenging due to is hardness, requiring high levels of polishing.<br>- Additionally, the natural shape of itself can be used in sculpting.</p>
